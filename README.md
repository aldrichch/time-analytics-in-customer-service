In the term of customer service, understanding customer needs and optimizing service delivery is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. With this in mind, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis to identify priority products for resolution and predict future service demand. Leveraging data analytics techniques, I conducted in-depth analysis to determine which products should be prioritized for resolution based on factors such as frequency of complaints and impact on customer satisfaction. Additionally, I utilized SARIMAX modeling to forecast future booking demand, providing valuable insights for resource planning and service optimization. This project aimed to empower organizations to proactively address customer needs, streamline service operations, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.
